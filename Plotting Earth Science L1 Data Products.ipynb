    "The beautiful world we live in is constantly changing and evolving. The media continuously reports and bring awareness of environmental issues such as global warming, climate change, pollution, and natural disasters. Huge debates over the casualty of environmental conditionings have led to massive protests, influenceability of political parties, adversely blaming the situation on natural disasters, and even challenging the creditability of scientists to predict and forecast disasters.\n",

    "In some instances, society cannot distinguish the root of the problem and decouple one issue from another. As shown in the image above, our eyes naturally focus on the dog walking on the beach. The dog could be playing fetch, exploring its environment, and moving randomly along the shoreline. Secondly, our eyes only focus on the person holding on to the leash once a usual or unnatural event occurs. As a reference from the Cosmos-Epsiode 2, Neil deGrasse Tyson deploys this analogy to explain the difference between weather and climate. \"Here's the difference between weather and climate. Weather is what the atmosphere does in the short term, hour-to-hour, or day-to-day. Weather is chaotic, which means that even a microscopic disturbance can lead to large-scale changes; that's why those 10-day weather forecasts are useless. The climate is the long-term average of the weather over a number of years. It's shaped by global forces that alter the energy balance in the atmosphere, such as changes in the Sun, tilts in the earth's axis, the amount of sunlight the earth reflects back to space, and the concentration of greenhouse gases in the air. A change in any of them affects the climate in ways that are broadly predictable.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrated in the image above, \"The dog meandering represents the short-term fluctuations that is the weather. It is almost impossible to predict what will attract the dog's interest next. It's difficult to know the results of the meandering because he is being held on a leash. We can't observe climate directly; all we see is the weather. The average weather over the course of years reveals a pattern.\" Neil deGrasse Tyson holding the leash is the person with the leash \"represents the long-term trend which is climate.\" \"Weather is hard to predict, but the climate is predictable. The climate has changed many times in the long history of the Earth, but always in response to the global force.\"\n",

    "   \n",
    "The Earth science community is a vast multi-disciplined group containing of Environmental scientists, Biologists, Soil Scientists, Foresters, Aronomists, Meteorlogists, Geophysicists, Marine biologists, Arborists, Geogrpahers, Oceanographers, Climatologists, Astronomers and much more. As mentioned in the background section, climate and weather can be a complex and sensitive topic requiring evidence data to support theory, concept, or experimentation. While some scientists are only concern the moisture of the soil others researchers maybe concern with the melting of icebergs and raise of sea levels. Futhermore, some scientists may only study the short-term affects of marine life population and others maybe researching devastation of civilization caused by cyclone and hurricane winds.\n",

    "![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/w83gIBblSJCF0qAZHi/giphy.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the research topic, the desire for graphical representation, similiar to the image above, is necessary to illustrate, represent, and communicate their message. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the community are not professional programmers, software engineers, and computer scientists. As a result, generating plots and animations is daunting task and is often outsourced to those individuals that are within the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Geospatial fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an Electrical Engineer with over a decade of experience, I found myself in the same predicament. I was new to the Earth science field and wanted to plot my data to represent my theory and equations. I had done countless hours of market research and fell short on locating a tool that is versatile, simple, and well supported. I was devasted to find that even a person with my creditial as a past software engineer of more than 5 years was incapable of finding a solution. On the contray, individuals such as Biologist, Foresters, and Soil scientists must felt even more overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, I had reviewed over 90 free software packages and 25 commerical license software to accomplish the task of analyzing earth science data, plots, and create animation. I had test trial some of these software packages. Most software packages are great at a single sole purpose, for example, soil mositure but are limited to global temperature, or wind speed. In addition, some software packages are in foriegn lanuages making it difficult to translate to my naivate language, English. As a result, I went a different market research path to locate for a programming lanuage suitlable for the task. Several contenders such as C++, MATLAB, and Python made the list; however, Python with cartopy provided the most verstiale and simipliest approach. In addition, cartopy is well supported with a large development team and  remained relevent since its released in 2012. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a scientist, it is my duty to contribute to the science community. I believe that Earth Science is a mixture of diverse group within a niche area. The group are filled with driven individuals that wants to improve the conditions for their children and generations that they may steps forward on this planet with the goal to leave the planet better than how it was left before their time. I hope that this project finds useful to scientists that had faced the same uphill problem that I once had faced. Regardless of the impact, the publication of this project will be useful for my personal gain as it contains all the lesson learned and procedures for future geospatial mapping and plotting projects.

    "### [4.3 Install Libraries](https://docs.anaconda.com/anacondaorg/commandreference/) ###\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers write code, they often need to analyze data that requires calculating complex algorithms to accurately graph spatial coordinates. However, writing this code from scratch can be time-consuming and generate errors. As a result, libraries are created to address the issue. Libraries are pre-written codes that programmers can import into their programs, which makes it easier to perform complex operations. For example, if a programmer wants to perform mathematical calculations in their program, they can import a math library with pre-written functions for doing these calculations. This saves time and makes the code easier to read and maintain. Therefore, programmers can write programs more efficiently, with fewer errors and more advanced features.\n",

Therefore, the approach is only to cover the essential topics related to this project and not to overwhelm those new to programming. For those who are experienced programmers, feel free to skip this section. Below are some helpful links to learn Python. This section will cover the following topics: \n",

    "\n",
    "NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files are commonly used in Earth science to store and share multidimensional scientific data, such as atmospheric and oceanographic data. These files provide a standardized format that allows scientists to easily exchange and analyze data across different platforms and software packages. netCDF files can contain a wide range of information, including metadata, spatial and temporal coordinates, and data values. This makes them an essential tool for scientists studying climate change, weather patterns, and other Earth science phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/images/logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization that standardizes netCDF file format is [UNIDATA University Corporation](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/) located in Boulder, CO. The company's core goal is to be the center for sharing, accessing, and data for visualization and analysis relating to geoscience. Furthermore, the standardization for NetCDF file format is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and has been supported by educational and research institutions for over 30 years. netCDF data format is a standard file that various software applications can view. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://anthroecology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/earthdata_logo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Unidata University Corp standardizes netCDF file format, [NASA's Earth Observing System Data and information System (EOSDIS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs) is designed as a distributed system to distribute earth science data. NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program oversees the life cycle of NASA’s Earth science data from acquisition through processing and distribution. The primary goal of ESDS is to maximize the scientific return from NASA's missions and experiments for research and applied scientists, decision makers, and society at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESDS data system and science products continuously evolve through a combination of competitive awards and sustained and strategic investments in open data, international and interagency partnerships, and a set of standards that ensure consistency and interoperability. Since 1994, Earth science data have been free and open to all users for any purpose, and since 2015, all data systems software developed through research and technology awards have been made available to the public as Open Source Software (OSS). ESDS falls within the purview of the Earth Science Division (ESD), under the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) at NASA Headquarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EOSDIS deploys major facilities throughout the United States, referred to as Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). These 10+ DAAC facilities process, achieve, document, and distribute data from NASA's past and current Earth-Observing Satellites and field measurement programs. Each DAAC is segmented into a particular expertise or discipline. For example, the Alaska Satellite Facility [(ASF) DAAC](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs/asf) is the custodian for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) disciplines; the National Snow and Ice Data Center [(NSIDC) DAAC](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs/nsidc) is the custodian for Snow, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, frozen ground, soil moisture, climate interactions, etc. disciplines; the Ocean Biology DAAC [(OB.DAAC)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs/obdaac) is the custodians for ocean color, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity disciplines; etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncovering the earth's mystery is a complicated and complex task requiring support from scientists of all backgrounds. NASA realizes that studying the earth is an essential mission as it is detrimental to the existence of life. As shown in the image below, NASA has launched many satellites in the effort to study the earth.\n",

    "Unfortunately, this project cannot cover the entire list of Earth Observing Satellites (EOS) illustrated in the image. Nonetheless, NASA's missions and showcasing creditable sources for these data product is worth mentioning. Because of the vast missions and disciplinary categories, NASA must standardize the data products to ensure consistency throughout all missions. As shown in the image, this product will provide programming examples using the [CYGNSS mission](https://cygnss.engin.umich.edu/) as the median to convey the concept. \n",

As a result, its data products are managed by the [Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC)](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/). The PODAAC is the custodian for gravity, ocean winds, sea surface temperature, ocean surface topography, sea surface salitinity, and circulation disciplines. The PODAAC archives and manages the distributions of netCDF files for the earth science community and supports data from numerous missions that focus on the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, cryopshere, and terrestial hydrosphere. As a NASA data center, PODAAC provides access to data from both current and past missions, including satellite missions like CYGNSS, Jason-3, Sentinel-6, and Aquarius, among many others. The mission netCDF data products files are regularly updated and can be downloaded from the PODAAC website for scientific research and other applications.

    "<span id=\"fn1\">1</span>: The line plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree()) sets up a GeoAxes instance which exposes a variety of other projections. [click here](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/crs/projections.html) for a list of projection. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\">2</span>: The core concept is that the projection of your axes is independent of the coordinate system your data is defined in. The **projection argument** is used when creating plots and determines the projection of the resulting plot (i.e. what the plot looks like). The **transform** argument to plotting functions tells Cartopy what coordinate system your data are defined in.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\">3</span>: Notice that the variable changed from ax (axis) to map. Both are used interchangable to denote that both x and y axis must be defined to generate a map. We will be using m denoting map moving forward throughout this program. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\">4</span>: Noticed that the legend will appear by default in the upper right hand corner according to the characterstics (color, line, etc) set from the plot. [click here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/legend_api.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\">5</span>: Noiced that seconds is multipled by 2. CYGNSS data for DMM time is measured by every half second interval with the accuracy of 1ns per sample. The handbook is a bit misleading. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\">6</span>: Noticed that figure is m3.figure. Fig3 or m3.figure will both work. I have discovered issues running both FuncAnimation function and anim.save function. It is best to execute the save function first then execute the html function afterwards to view the animated plot/map."
